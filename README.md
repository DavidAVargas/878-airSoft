Airsoft Arena Website Improvement Project

Introduction:

This project aims to improve the website of [Airsoft Arena], a premier airsoft gaming facility in [your town/city]. As a student in a coding boot camp and a passionate customer of Airsoft Arena, I've noticed several areas where the website's user experience could be enhanced. By addressing these issues, we aim to provide a smoother experience for users and potentially attract more customers to the arena.

Motivation:

As a fellow customer of Airsoft Arena, I've experienced firsthand the frustrations of navigating through a buggy website and the need to call the arena for information not readily available online. Moreover, the website's reliance on outdated technologies like jQuery is evident, highlighting the need for a modernization effort. By improving the website, we not only enhance the customer experience but also contribute to the growth and success of a business we value.

Objectives:

Enhance user experience by addressing usability issues and improving navigation.
Fix bugs and optimize website performance to ensure smooth functionality.
Modernize the website by replacing outdated technologies like jQuery with more current alternatives.
Provide comprehensive information about the airsoft arena, including pricing, events, and facility details, to reduce the need for customer inquiries.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React (or other modern frontend frameworks/libraries)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (or any preferred backend technologies)
Database: MongoDB (or any preferred database system)
Other Tools: Visual Studio Code (IDE), Git (version control), GitHub (project hosting and collaboration)
